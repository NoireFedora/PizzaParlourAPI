Pair Programming (14.5/15):
The report contained some good reflections on what went well and not well in the process.
It would be nice to be more explicit on which commits were done with pair programming. It is a bit hard to figure out from the commit messages.


Program design (16/20):
The program design is good in general, but did not talk about any design patterns used specifically.

Functionality (24/25):
Have simple input error checking against wrong inputs.
CLI is mostly easy to use and all the functionality that were tested worked. It would be better if user doesn't have to type all the selections (e.g. use a numbering system) or they can pick using up/down arrows.


Tests (14/20):
The project achieved around 50% coverage, coverage was lower mainly due to operations.py. 
Don't need to start the server before all the tests can pass. 


Code Craftsmanship (8/10):
Some comments were provided in the code.
The coding style looks clean and consistent.
The report briefly mentioned the tools being used for development.

md explanation and organization (8.5/10):
The readme file included good set of instructions on how to run and test the program.
Would be nice to include the set of dependencies that need to be installed for the program too.
